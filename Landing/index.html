		<h2>PNL</h2>
		<p>Firstly, PNL, the name stands for Peace N' Lovés, a pun based on the well-known expression "Peace N' Love", in french argo "lovés" means money. PNL is a band made out of two brothers. They democratised a way of using their voices whith technological tools, that makes them unique but on the other hand that is why you can easily hate their music. Their imagination for their clips is another part of their success, they shot a globaly known video on the Eiffel Tower, "Au DD"</p>

		<h2>BOOBA</h2>
		<p>Booba is a iconic french rapper, you must have had heard about him, if not about his music it must have been because of all his controversial actions. Indeed, Booba is known to be very provocative but in his way he can also be considered a whistle-blower. He informs about the too big influence and the scams of french influencers. Musically speaking, Booba is not all pink, because of his vindicative songs against society some might be shocked. On the other hand there is no denying that Booba always managed to adapt, that is why after more than twenty years of career he is still on top.</p>

		<h2>ALPHA WANN</h2>
		<p>Alpha Wann is not as known as Booba or PNL, his style is considered not as mainstream as theirs. He focuses on the writing with wonderful rhymes and an extraordinary thecnicity. He started a solo career after a few years in a collective called the 1995, in the band other rappers emerged such as Jazzy Bazz, Sneazzy or Nekfeu. As, I wrote in my profile I am a fan, I listened hours of his songs and I only can recommand it to anybody who likes good rap.</p>
